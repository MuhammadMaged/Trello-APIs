# Trello APIS Testing with Postman, Newman, and Jenkins CI/CD

This repository is dedicated to automating the testing of Trello APIs using a comprehensive toolkit that includes Postman collections, Newman for command-line execution, and Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation. The Trello API serves as a sample platform for testing and learning, and the test modules are designed to cover a wide range of endpoints and scenarios to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API.

## Generating HTML Reports
Newman supports multiple reporters, including htmlextra, which generates detailed HTML reports for your API test runs. To generate HTML reports, simply specify the -r htmlextra option when running Newman, as shown in the example above.

The HTML reports will be available in the reports directory of this repository.

## Jenkins CI/CD
The repository is configured to automate the API testing process using Jenkins for CI/CD. Jenkins pipelines are set up to trigger API tests when changes are pushed to the repository. Jenkins will run the tests, generate HTML reports, and provide feedback on the test results.
